## Hey!! ðŸŽ‰

My name is Dante Solorzano. This is my school account where I post repositories on anything I'm working on throughout my computer science degrees, all for archival and synchronous purposes.

I'm currently focusing on web development, with an extreme facination for native applications using languages such as C# and C++!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final semester of college!
